# Gatsby Remark oEmbed Plugin

_Drop a link to oEmbed content (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, CodePen etc.) and see it transform into proper embed html._

&nbsp;  
ðŸš¨ gatsby-plugin-mdx support is lacking due to problems with Gatsby Cache in sub-plugins.

## A note on oEmbed

> oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly.

Learn more by checking out [oembed.com](https://oembed.com].

Links dropped into your markdown content is checked against the oEmbed provider list from [oembed.com](https://oembed.com/#section7). If there is a match a call is made to the provider's oEmbed endpoint and the link is swapped for the embed html.

The provider list is downloaded on every build so that oEmbed support stays up to date.

So far these providers are confirmed to be working: CodePen, Flickr, Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, Vimeo, YouTube, SoundCloud.

Twitter, Flickr, Instagram and Reddit requires external javascript to be added to every page. So make sure to exclude the ones you do not need.

> **Warning:** The Instagram oEmbed API requires an access token. You'll need a Facebook Developer account, a Facebook App, and an App Access Token. [More information here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram/oembed), or take a look at this [tutorial for setting it all up in Gatsby with Environment Variables](https://phil.tech/2020/gatsby-instagram-oembed-failures/).

> **Update:** Twitch removed oEmbed support in 2020 when deprecating their v5 API. It seems they are not planning to support oEmbed again. Unfortunately this means Twitch urls are no longer being transformed. Let them know how you feel about this [on their forum](https://discuss.dev.twitch.tv/t/oembed-deprecation/24424/2).

## How to use

### Configuration

```js
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        {
          resolve: `@raae/gatsby-remark-oembed`,
          options: {
            // usePrefix defaults to false
            // usePrefix: true is the same as ["oembed"]
            usePrefix: ["oembed", "video"],
            providers: {
              // Important to exclude providers
              // that adds js to the page.
              // If you do not need them.
              exclude: ["Reddit"],
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
];
```

#### Settings per provider

Many oEmbed providers offer additional options for configure the display of the embed.

For example, for Twitter see [Embedded Tweet parameter reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/embedded-tweets/guides/embedded-tweet-parameter-reference), which describes the additional oEmbed parameters you might want to change for the embed.

```js
// â€¦
{
  resolve: `@raae/gatsby-remark-oembed`,
  options: {
    usePrefix: true,
    providers: {
      include: [
        'Twitter',
        'Instagram',
      ],
      settings: {
        // Ex. Show all Twitter embeds with the dark theme, and disables ad tracking
        Twitter: {
          theme: 'dark',
          dnt: true
        },
        // Ex. Hide all Instagram comments by default, and
        // add a facebook access token
        Instagram: {
           hidecaption: true,
           access_token: 'a-facebook-access-token'
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Content

#### With setting `usePrefix: true`

```md
// In your markdown file

Check it out! I can use oembed links in my markdown.

`oembed: https://twitter.com/raae/status/1045394833001652225`

Its pretty cool :D

`oembed: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bof9WhgBmY2/`
```

Links must be surrounded by empty lines.

#### With setting `usePrefix: array of prefixes`

If you would like to use a prefix other than "oembed" or multiple prefixes you can set `usePrefix` to an array of custom prefixes. This can be beneficial when converting from other embed plugins.

`usePrefix: ["embed", "video", "oembed"]`

```md
// In your markdown file

Check it out! I can use the prefix "oembed:"

`oembed: https://twitter.com/raae/status/1045394833001652225`

Or I can use the prefix "embed:" if I like ;)

`embed: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bof9WhgBmY2/`

I can also use "video:" like I did before with `gatsby-remark-video`.

`video: https://vimeo.com/42672205`
```

`usePrefix: true` in the section above is the same as `usePrefix: ["oembed"]`.

#### With setting `usePrefix: false`

```md
// In your markdown file

Check it out! I can use oembed links in my markdown.

https://twitter.com/raae/status/1045394833001652225

Its pretty cool :D
